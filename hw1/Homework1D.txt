This is a screenshot from Katamari Damacy, a game where
the player rools around ball that collects pretty much
any mesh in the scene it collides with, as long as the
mesh is roughly smaller than the current size of the
ball. When an environmental object or a wall is between
the katamari and the camera, a shader drills a little
hole in the wall so that the player still has vision
of the katamari. It is an elegant solution for what
could potentially be a lot of gameplay-disrupting
annoyance.

I think the effect is a result of a dynamically-sized
x-ray sphere that makes any parts of a mesh it is
colliding with transparent. The sphere is always in
the center of the camera. It does not relate to lighting
because everything in katamari damacy is cell shaded.
It is designed to update the appearence of only
colliding pixels on the target object's transform to
make them transparent.

This is an effect that would be useful in my 170 game,
if I can figure it out in Unity.
