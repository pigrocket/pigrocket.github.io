    <h1>Caustics</h1>    
    <p>
    From the video we saw last week, it appears to me that caustics work by
    mapping a texture to transparent geometry. <br>
    That texture redfracts the ray particles as they hit the geometry, and
    project a distorted caustic on the next geometry the light probes hit. <br> 
    </p>
    <br>

    This is an image of a real-life caustic filtered by a glass cup. The light <br>
    refraction does not need to be accurate to look like a high-definition caustic. <br>
    Sometimes, a graphics engineer wants the caustic to be completely accurate. <br>
    In this case, complex techniques like photon mapping are used for maximum fidelity. <br>
    
    It is my impression that caustics won't be generated on a surface where there is <br>
    no direct path from light source, to the transparent object, to the surface. <br>
    Caustics are rendered perpendicular to the light source, so that orbiting the light <br>
    around the gemotry rotates the caustic around the caustic around the geometry. <br>
    </p>

    Here we see a computer generated glass cup and caustic. It has been rendered with
    photon mapping to achieve sufficient fidelity.
